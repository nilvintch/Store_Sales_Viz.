# Store_Sales_Viz.
## Introduction

This repository contains an in-depth analysis and visualization of sales data from a global superstore. The dataset comprises a total of 51,290 rows and 26 fields, providing comprehensive insights into various aspects of orders, customers, products, and shipping. The primary objective of this project is to extract valuable insights into sales patterns, profitability, and shipping trends across different categories, sub-categories, segments, and regions.

## Visualization and Analysis Highlights

### Profit across Categories

We utilize a bar graph to visually represent the sales, discounts, and profit for each category, namely Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology. An interesting observation is that the Furniture category experienced a decline in profit despite significant discounts.

### Shipping Preferences

A donut chart is employed to illustrate the distribution of shipping modes. The analysis reveals that the "Standard Class" emerged as the preferred shipping mode, accounting for an impressive 60% of total shipments.

### Segment-wise Sales

We present a bar graph that depicts sales figures for distinct segments, including Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office. The Consumer segment stands out with the highest sales, totaling an impressive 6,500,000 units.

### Comparative Category Analysis

A bar graph is generated to compare sales performance among different categories. Notably, Technology products emerge as the top sellers, while Office Supplies display the lowest sales figures.

### Sales vs. Profit by Sub-Category

To understand the interplay between sales and profit across sub-categories, a bar graph is employed to visualize sales values, accompanied by a superimposed line graph representing profit fluctuations within sub-categories.

### Interactive Tableau Dashboard

We've designed a comprehensive interactive dashboard that integrates key visualizations. A noteworthy feature is the "Sales by Country" graph, which features a dynamic filter enabling users to focus on countries with substantial profits (depicted in dark green) or losses (depicted in red). This responsive dashboard updates in real-time based on the selected country, providing an intuitive user experience.
